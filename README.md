This was for a college project that my team and I worked on. We used the S&P 500 data and created a time series model for stock price prediction and fluctuation. Another part of the project was detecting data drift in the stock market which we successfully implemented. Due to college guidelines I cannot share the models, however, I am happy to answer questions.
